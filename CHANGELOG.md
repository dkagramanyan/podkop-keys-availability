# Changelog

Versions are podkop-probe's (`probe.sh`); a release also carries
podkop-agent and podkop-manager.

## 1.25.0 — 2026-10-19

- **No outage when only servers change** (podkop-agent 0.5.0). podkop's
  restart stops sing-box, removes its firewall rules and DNS setup, rebuilds
  everything and loads the IP lists again: 20-30 s in which nothing goes
  through the proxy. When an apply changes only which servers rules use
  (the nightly probe, Take links from probe, edited server lists), the agent
  now builds the new sing-box config with podkop's own functions (the same
  `sing_box_init_config` its start runs), puts it in place and has sing-box
  reload it in place (SIGHUP). Firewall, DNS and lists stay as they are.
  - On openwrt-reserv with openwrt-main's config: DNS through sing-box
    checked every 0.1 s failed 0-1 times during the swap (about 0.1 s),
    against 20-30 s for a restart; sing-box stays the same process.
  - The config is byte for byte what podkop's own restart writes (checked:
    a restart afterwards reports "configuration is unchanged").
  - Any other change (domains, lists, DNS, settings) still restarts podkop,
    and so does a swap that fails for any reason; the health check and the
    automatic undo work as before.
  - The apply dialog shows "sing-box took the new servers, podkop kept
    running" (manager 0.15.0).

## 1.24.0 — 2026-10-18

- **Nightly probe in the rules:** its settings (time, apply by itself, TLS
  fingerprint, where servers are tested, podkop-engine download) moved from
  Global settings into every rule that takes links from the probe, under the
  rule's probe parameters. It stays one run for all those rules, so they
  share the settings. Overview's **Schedule** opens such a rule.
- Manager 0.14.0.

## 1.23.0 — 2026-10-18

- **Add router without the root password** (published here: the v1.22.0
  release was made before it, so its install.sh lacked `--release`). Add
  router shows a command to run on the router. It downloads install.sh of the manager's own release
  (`--release`) and installs podkop-agent, podkop-probe and the manager's key,
  with the Clash API options and, if ticked, the forwarding-only key
  (`--forward-key`; a run without it removes that key). At the end it prints
  `podkop-router <address> <port> <host key>`; pasted into Add router, the
  manager checks that this host key answers and that its key runs
  podkop-agent there before it adds the router. **Reinstall agent** shows the
  same command. The password fields and PODKOP_MANAGER_ROUTER_PASSWORD are
  gone; the manager never logs in with a password.
- **Faster build:** podkop-engine is no longer in the Docker image. GitHub
  serves it slowly (~100 KB/s), and a build stopped during the download lost
  the cached apt step too. The manager now downloads it once in the
  background when it starts (~13 MB, checked by SHA-256) into the data
  volume, where rebuilds keep it. Global settings shows the download and
  has a button to try again if it failed. Testing servers on the manager's
  server works as before once it is there.
- Manager 0.13.0.

## 1.22.0 — 2026-10-18

- **Test servers on the manager's server, through the router** (manager
  0.12.0, Global settings → Nightly probe → Test servers). The router only
  reads the keys (with its own device ID, as before) and turns each server
  into a sing-box outbound with podkop's own parser (podkop-agent 0.4.0:
  `probe-nodes`; podkop-probe `--build-nodes`). The manager's container runs
  podkop-probe on them (`--nodes FILE`) with podkop-engine-full, and every
  test connection, the DNS for the servers' names included, goes out through
  the router over SSH (`--via`), so the servers see the router's address and
  the router's processor and memory stay free.
  - It uses a second manager key that may only forward connections: the page
    shows its line for `/etc/dropbear/authorized_keys`
    (`command="/bin/false",no-agent-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-pty`), and
    **Check the router** tries it. The manager never changes the router's keys.
  - Servers that use UDP (hysteria2, TUIC, WireGuard) can't be tested
    through SSH and are skipped.
  - The Docker image adds busybox, curl, jq and podkop-engine-full's static
    sing-box (checked by SHA-256). The backup keeps the second key.

## 1.21.0 — 2026-10-18

- **Faster probe:** one sing-box runs every server under test, each behind its
  own local port, instead of one sing-box per server: no start-up per server,
  and a few MB per server tested instead of ~40 MB. Servers are tested one per
  CPU core at a time (a router with ~100 MB free managed only 2 before; more
  than the CPU can handshake makes every ping look slower). A server sing-box
  refuses is set aside with its message; if sing-box stops during the test, it
  is started again and the servers tested meanwhile are tested again.
- **Less work per server:** 20 ping requests instead of 40 (losses still show
  in 5% steps), and a speed test of 3 s instead of up to 8 s. The speed counts
  from the first second on, after the tunnel's ramp-up, so the short test
  gives the steady speed. A test also ends after 2 s when the outcome is clear
  (at 85% of the line's own speed and above the minimum: a node can't show
  more than the line). `-n`, `-F` and `-q` (now 2 s) set other sizes.
  On openwrt-reserv (dual core, 35 servers, a ~45 Mbit/s line): 347 s → ~175 s.
- The test's local ports start at 20000, below the ones Linux gives outgoing
  connections, and a port held by any connection is skipped (a busy port could
  stop the test from starting).
- Manager 0.11.0: **Overview → Now routing** shows where each rule's traffic
  leaves to the internet: country and exit IP of the server it uses now (or
  of a VPN rule's interface), looked up when the server changes and hourly.
- **Less flash wear on the router:**
  - the nightly self-update downloads to /tmp and writes
    /usr/bin/podkop-probe only for a newer version;
  - the probe's own nightly run doesn't rewrite /etc/config/podkop or restart
    podkop when the servers are the same;
  - the agent rewrites its pins file only when a pin was dropped.
- podkop-agent 0.3.2: `exit-ip <section>`; the router's UTC offset in the
  status.

Fixes from a review of the whole project:

- **Security:**
  - podkop-agent accepts only http(s) subscription keys;
  - podkop-probe never passes a key to curl where it could be read as an
    option;
  - **Reinstall agent** checks the router's SSH host key before it sends the
    root password;
  - install.sh refuses a cut-off download of the agent or the probe.
- **The router keeps its settings:**
  - after a crash the watchdog restarts podkop with the settings it has (made
    in LuCI or by the probe) and goes back to the last applied ones only if
    podkop does not start with them;
  - a moment when ubus does not answer no longer looks like changed settings;
  - Restart and Stop from the manager wait for an apply in progress;
  - the probe's own run waits for the agent's apply;
  - an apply killed while the agent runs (out of memory) is undone at once,
    not at the next reboot.
- **Agent:**
  - several checks at once no longer share scratch files;
  - pins come back even when the Clash API answers late, and two pin changes
    at once don't lose one;
  - a probe that could not start, ran past 3 hours or was killed is marked
    failed, and its sing-box and work folder are removed;
  - the traffic counts in RAM keep only the current links;
  - a refused probe request no longer replaces the last run's.
- **Manager:**
  - a command that times out closes its SSH channel;
  - a move of rules for a traffic limit counts only once the router took it
    (it is tried again otherwise), runs in the background, one at a time;
  - rules and their preview never get the servers of a key moved away from;
  - **Let the manager run it** keeps the time on the router's clock (the
    manager may run in another time zone), takes the router's keys when the
    manager has none, and refuses a cron line without one daily time;
  - an imported YouTube list with several countries takes the first, and
    "any country" becomes "plays";
  - with the fingerprint fix on, the probe table shows where the fixed
    servers went;
  - removing a router stops its probe and apply tracking;
  - a probe still running after 3 hours is marked failed;
  - install steps time out;
  - bad input gets a 400 instead of a 500.
- **UI:**
  - draft saves go one at a time (fast typing on a slow line no longer
    reports "changed elsewhere" and loses the edit);
  - Rules and Global settings open from the last read settings when the router
    is away, and switching between rules doesn't read the router again;
  - the page no longer stays dimmed after a quick click elsewhere;
  - Review and apply, Show older, Save config and Add key ignore a second
    click while the first is under way;
  - renaming or duplicating a probe rule keeps its probe parameters on the
    page that opens next.

## 1.20.0 — 2026-10-18

- Manager 0.10.0: adding a router that already runs podkop changes nothing in
  podkop:
  - its settings are saved in **Configs** ("as found");
  - the subscriptions of a podkop-probe that runs there by itself go into
    **Keys and usage**;
  - its main and YouTube lists become rules that take links from the probe,
    with the same countries and limits.
  - Overview says when that podkop-probe still runs by itself every night.
    **Let the manager run it** turns its cron line off and runs the probe from
    the manager at the same time.
- **Add router** and **Reinstall agent** can leave the firewall as it is
  (Clash API stays open to the LAN).
- **Without podkop-engine:** the agent installs, reads and applies settings.
  Overview says the probe can't run there.
- **TLS fingerprint:** a switch in Global settings → Nightly probe gives REALITY
  links with fp=qq, 360, ios, android or edge (rejected by servers since
  Xray-core v26.9.8) fp=chrome, both in the probe's test and in podkop. A rule's
  own links show a **Use chrome** fix.
- Logs: wget's progress from podkop's list update and crond's job starts are
  no longer shown as errors.
- podkop-agent 0.3.1: `probe-config`, `probe-cron off`, engine and probe cron
  in the status. podkop-probe: `--fix-fingerprint`.

## 1.19.0 — 2026-10-18

- Manager 0.9.0: **Routing → Configs**. Save a router's running config or
  its draft, with each rule's probe parameters; download it as a JSON file;
  import such a file or podkop's own `/etc/config/podkop`; load any saved
  config into a router's draft (its probe rules get the last probe's
  servers right away).
- **Settings → Backup**: download the whole manager (database and SSH key)
  as one `.tar.gz`, and restore it, e.g. on a new server.
- **YouTube region** in a rule's probe parameters: not checked, any (video
  plays), or the country YouTube must detect (RU: no ads), instead of the
  fixed "sees Russia".
- The manager's probe runs judge servers by their exit only
  (`--no-entry-check`): relays that enter in another country, like
  whitelist bypasses entering in Russia, are no longer dropped before the
  test. A rule whose countries no tested server exits in says so.
- Stability fixes in the manager:
  - **Background work:** polling, usage, the nightly scheduler and pruning
    no longer stop for good after an unexpected error. A garbled answer
    from the router marks it offline instead.
  - **Nightly probe:** if the router is unreachable at the set time, it is
    retried within the hour.
  - **Traffic limits:**
    - A key is no longer avoided again right after its provider reset.
    - A failed move to other keys is retried every 10 minutes.
    - Keys counted on the router include the current hour.
  - **Restore:** only one runs at a time. Apply tracking stops before it,
    and the upload size is checked while it arrives.
  - **Bad input:** files, rules and requests get a clear error instead of
    a server error. The login check no longer blocks the server.
  - **Cleanup:** old versions (beyond 500 per router) and old probe results
    (beyond 30) are pruned. A removed router or key leaves no settings or
    traffic behind.
  - **UI:**
    - Probe parameters keep focus while you type, and Exit IP keeps the
      spaces between addresses.
    - A rule editor you left can no longer overwrite the draft.
    - Live updates reconnect after an error.
    - Overview reads the config once the router is back.
- **Discard** also puts back the rules' probe parameters (and what "Load
  into draft" changed) as they were before the draft.
- **Two tabs:** a draft changed in another tab, or by "Load into draft", is
  no longer overwritten. The page reloads it instead.
- **After a restart or restore:** the manager follows the changes and probe
  runs the router was still busy with.
- **Traffic per server:** with agent 0.3.0, traffic is credited to the
  server it went through, not to the position in the rule. Moving servers
  no longer mixes up their bytes.
- podkop-agent 0.3.0 (**Settings → Reinstall agent** on each router to get it):
  - **Interrupted apply:** a change cut off by a reboot or a killed process
    is undone when the agent starts again (event "apply_interrupted").
  - **Killed probe:** a probe killed for lack of memory shows as failed,
    instead of "running" forever.
  - **Failed undo:** when the old settings can't be put back, the change is
    reported as failed instead of "the old settings are back".
  - **Smaller fixes:**
    - The apply lock is no longer held by podkop's own background jobs.
    - `last-good` is written atomically.
    - A damaged traffic state is reset.
- podkop-probe:
  - **Self-update:** a cut-off download is never installed (end marker and
    `sh -n`).
  - **Server names:** names like "Безлимит" or "Для всех устройств" are no
    longer taken for placeholder entries. Control characters in names
    don't break the results.
  - **Cleanup and memory:** a closed SSH session cleans up the test
    sing-box instances. The YouTube and speed tests respect the router's
    free RAM.
  - **Nightly lock:** a stale `--cron` lock no longer blocks every run.
  - **Relays:** relays that share one entry address but differ in SNI,
    path or user get their own speed and YouTube tests instead of copying
    another one's.

## 1.18.0 — 2026-10-18

- Manager 0.8.0: the Servers and Servers probe pages are gone. **Keys and
  usage** comes right after Overview.
- A Fastest (URLTest) rule has a **Take links from probe** switch; when on,
  the probe's parameters (region, protocol, exit IP, name, ping, speed,
  YouTube, how many) and **Run probe** are shown under it.
- The probe tests the countries of the rules (all, if a rule takes any);
  the probe page's countries move into the rules once ("Europe" is one
  choice in the rule). Schedule and auto-apply are in **Global settings**.
- Overview: **Review and apply** for a new probe result, **Unpin** for a
  pinned rule.

## 1.17.0 — 2026-10-18

- Manager 0.7.0: every rule, main and youtube included, can take its servers
  from the probe, each with its own filter (countries, protocols, exit IP,
  name), how many to keep, ping and speed limits, and a YouTube requirement
  (plays, or sees Russia without ads). The probe's own main and YouTube
  lists are gone; existing ones turn into such rules with the same limits.
- Servers probe keeps what to test (countries, quick run), the schedule and
  auto-apply; the probe tests with the loosest limits of the rules.
- Keys are added and removed under **Keys and usage** (subscriptions and
  single links); Servers probe only lists them.
- Login name: `PODKOP_MANAGER_USER` in `.env` (default `admin`).

## 1.16.0 — 2026-10-18

- Manager 0.6.0: new page **Keys and usage**. For each key: used today
  against its limit, a forecast at the last 3 hours' rate, the split by rule,
  the last 14 days and today's traffic by server. The menu shows the highest
  daily limit used, Overview warns when a key will run out today.
- Limits come from the provider (subscription-userinfo, read every 10 min)
  or are set by you; single links can be added as keys with their own limit.
- At 90% (or your threshold) a key either only warns or moves its rules:
  the probe's rules that use its servers are rebuilt from the last probe
  without them, through the usual checked apply, and put back after the
  reset. History shows these changes as "traffic limit".
- Agent 0.2.0: counts traffic per server from sing-box's connections, and
  reads each key's usage through podkop-probe (same device for the
  provider). Reinstall the agent from Settings to get it.
- probe: `--sub-info` prints each key's usage header and links.
- `.env`: `TZ` sets the time zone for "today" and the nightly probe.

## 1.15.0 — 2026-10-18

- Manager 0.5.0: pages swap in when their data is loaded, with a short fade,
  instead of going blank first; quick clicks show only the last page.
- Servers probe: a key's result ("device limit reached", server count) is
  shown only next to the key that ran, not next to whatever key now sits in
  the same place in the list.
- Less text: no page subtitles, shorter hints; the probe table drops the OK
  column (hover the result instead).

## 1.14.1 — 2026-10-18

- The web interface's port is `PODKOP_MANAGER_PORT` in `.env` (default 8080).

## 1.14.0 — 2026-10-18

- Manager 0.4.0: credentials come from `.env`: `PODKOP_MANAGER_PASSWORD`
  (web login) and optionally `PODKOP_MANAGER_ROUTER_PASSWORD` (used when the
  root password field is left empty). `set-password` and the password change
  in Settings are gone; a new password logs everyone out.

## 1.13.0 — 2026-10-18

- The repository is now `podkop-manager` (old links redirect).
- Manager 0.3.0 runs with Docker Compose (`compose.yaml`, host network, data
  in a volume); `install-ubuntu.sh` and the systemd unit are removed.
- New layout: the manager at the root, router files in `router/`. Release
  assets keep their names, so installed routers keep updating.
- One README for everything.

## 1.12.0 — 2026-10-18

- Manager 0.2.0: new web interface: a menu with a router switcher, Overview,
  Routing rules, Global settings, Servers, Servers probe, Logs, History,
  Settings.
- Changes to rules and settings collect in a draft kept on the server until
  **Review and apply**; the apply dialog shows each step live.
- Rules can take servers from your subscriptions: by exit country, protocol,
  exit IP or name. They are refreshed after every probe run.
- Logs filter by source (podkop, sing-box, engine, agent) and level.
- History shows what started each change (you, a restore, the probe) and
  pages back further. Restoring an old version goes through the same check.
- Password can be changed in Settings.
- Probe page shows each key's result ("device limit reached", server count).
- probe: links with the same exit IP are no longer dropped; the best links
  are kept in order.
- probe: saves each server's link next to the results (`<csv>.links`).
- Agent 0.1.1: passes those links on and returns the full probe log.

## 1.11.0 — 2026-10-17

- podkop-manager: web interface on a Linux server for podkop on one or more
  routers: all settings and sections, checked apply with history and
  restore, server pinning, delay tests, probe runs (manual or nightly),
  live logs.
- podkop-agent on the router: checks every change before podkop is touched,
  undoes it if podkop doesn't start, brings podkop back after a crash,
  keeps pinned servers after restarts.
- `agent/install.sh`: agent, probe, a key that may run only the agent,
  Clash API closed to the LAN.

## 1.10.1 — 2026-10-17

- Shorter README; download and update links use the current repo name.

## 1.10.0 — 2026-10-17

- Needs podkop 0.7.24 and podkop-engine. Servers are built by podkop's own
  parser, so they are tested exactly as podkop runs them; xhttp works.
- The next 5 servers of each list go into podkop's fallback links.
- After the restart: wait for podkop's groups, reset a hand-picked server,
  restore the old settings if podkop fails to start.
- Clear message when a key's device limit is reached.

## 1.9.1 — 2026-09-27

- "y" at the final question applies (it used to do nothing); unknown
  answers ask again.
- `--apply-saved` applies the last run's lists without testing again.

## 1.9.0 — 2026-09-27

- Separate `youtube` section (above `main`) with servers where YouTube sees
  Russia (no ads).
- Never picked: ping 700 ms or more, 40 Mbit/s or less (`--max-ping`,
  `--min-speed`).
- Choose where to apply: both, main, youtube, or other sections
  (`--apply-to`).

## 1.8.0 — 2026-09-27

- YouTube check: servers where YouTube doesn't play are never picked.
- Fix: the settings file with the keys was readable by everyone.

## 1.7.0 — 2026-09-26

- `--install` asks for keys, countries and time; menu item 4 changes them.

## 1.6.0 — 2026-09-26

- "Repeat this every night?" installs `/usr/bin/podkop-probe` with the saved
  keys; the nightly line is `podkop-probe --cron`, which also updates
  itself. Log in `/tmp/podkop-probe.log`.
- `--install`, `--update`, `--uninstall`.
- Quieter output: one progress line, a short table, one question.

## 1.5.0 — 2026-09-26

- Several speed tests at once, sized to the router's line.
- "Europe only" also checks the server's IP, so relays through Russia are
  skipped.
- Fix: the pick list always showed speed as "-".

## 1.4.0 — 2026-09-26

- Fix: the speed test showed 0 Mbit/s on every server.
- Speed test stops once the result is stable; links to the same server share
  one test.

## 1.3.0 — 2026-09-26

- Latency and speed tested in one session per server; picks ranked by
  latency and speed equally.
- Type server numbers at the end to choose your own.

## 1.2.0 — 2026-09-26

- Subscriptions fetched like Happ, Streisand, INCY and others do, so panels
  return real servers; JSON subscriptions supported.
- Country filter (`--countries`), Europe by default.
- Subscription name, traffic and expiry shown.
- `tools/sub-check.sh`: what a subscription returns to each client app.

## 1.1.0 — 2026-09-26

- Several subscriptions at once, speed test, nightly run.
- podkop isn't restarted when the picked servers didn't change.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-09-26

- First version: tests every server of a subscription on the router, picks
  the best and puts them into podkop.
