# podkop-manager

A web interface on a Linux server for [podkop](https://github.com/itdoginfo/podkop)
on one or more OpenWrt routers: rules and settings, a nightly test of your VPN
subscriptions ("keys"), saved configs, backups, logs and a history of every
change. The probe needs
[podkop-engine](https://github.com/FiyeroT/podkop-engine) on the router.

```
server: podkop-manager ── SSH, a key that may run only podkop-agent ──▶ router: podkop-agent
  web UI, schedule, history                                            checks, applies, undoes,
                                                                       watchdog, pins, probe
```

Every change is checked before podkop is touched. If podkop doesn't come up
with it, the router puts the old settings back within about 30 s, even when
the manager is offline.

## Install on the server

Needs Docker with the compose plugin.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dkagramanyan/podkop-manager
cd podkop-manager
cp .env.example .env && chmod 600 .env   # set your login and password in it
docker compose up -d --build
```

Open `http://<server>:8080`. Everything you set lives in `.env`: the port,
the web login and password. After changing
it: `docker compose up -d`. Update: `git pull && docker compose up -d --build`.
Data (database, SSH keys) is in the `podkop-manager_data` volume. Logs:
`docker compose logs -f`.

## Add a router

**Settings → Add router** shows a command: run it on the router as root
over SSH. It installs podkop-agent with a watchdog,
podkop-probe and the manager's key (allowed to run only podkop-agent), and
optionally closes podkop's Clash API (port 9090) to the LAN, except the
computers you list, and adds the manager's forwarding-only key (to test
servers on the manager's server). At the end it prints a line
`podkop-router <address> <port> <host key>`: paste it into Add router, which
checks that the manager reaches that router with its key. No password is
needed; **Reinstall agent** shows the command again. podkop itself is not changed: its
settings are saved in **Configs**, and the keys and lists of a podkop-probe
that already runs there are taken into **Keys and usage** and the rules.
**Settings → Remove** undoes all of it.

## Good to know

- Changes collect in a draft until **Review and apply**.
- A **Fastest (URLTest)** rule can **Take links from probe**: region,
  protocol, exit IP, name, ping, speed, YouTube and how many to keep. Its
  servers are refreshed after every probe run; **Run probe** is in the rule.
- Nightly probe: **Global settings** → Nightly probe.
- **Test servers on this server, through the router** (Global settings →
  Nightly probe): the router only reads the keys and builds the servers with
  podkop's own parser; the manager's container tests them, and every test
  connection goes out through the router over SSH, so the servers still see
  the router's address and the router's processor stays free. Add the line
  it shows to the router's `/etc/dropbear/authorized_keys` once: it lets the
  manager's second key forward connections and nothing else (no shell, no
  commands). Servers that use UDP (hysteria2, TUIC) can't be tested this way.
- **Overview → Now routing**: each rule's server now and where its traffic
  leaves to the internet (country and exit IP).
- **Configs**: save a router's config (podkop plus each rule's probe
  parameters), download it, import a file (one from here or podkop's
  `/etc/config/podkop`) and load any saved config into a router's draft.
- **Settings → Backup**: the whole manager in one file (routers, keys, rules,
  configs, history, SSH keys), and **Restore…** on a new server. Keep the file
  private.
- **Keys and usage**: add subscriptions and single links here, and see each
  key's traffic against its limit (from the provider or your own). At 90% it warns, or moves the probe's rules to other keys
  until the reset.
- To stop podkop, use **Stop**: otherwise the watchdog starts it again within
  about 30 s (**Disable** in LuCI turns that off).

## podkop-probe without the manager

Tests every server of your keys on the router and puts the best into podkop:
10 fastest into section `main`, 10 fastest where YouTube sees Russia (no ads)
into section `youtube`, each with 5 fallback servers. On the router:

```sh
sh <(wget -O - https://github.com/dkagramanyan/podkop-manager/releases/latest/download/probe.sh)
```

1. **Enter**, paste your keys (one per line), then an empty line.
2. **Enter** for "Europe only". Wait 2–7 minutes.
3. Tables: `*` = main, `y` = YouTube, `f` = fallback. **Enter** puts both
   lists into podkop and restarts it (`1` only main, `2` only YouTube,
   `3` other sections, `n` nothing).
4. "Repeat this every night?" **Enter** installs `podkop-probe` with your
   keys. Then in LuCI → **System → Scheduled Tasks** add
   `30 4 * * * podkop-probe --cron`.

Each night it updates itself, tests the keys and updates podkop; if podkop
doesn't start with the new lists, the old settings stay. Same servers as
before: nothing is written to the router's flash and podkop isn't restarted. Log:
`/tmp/podkop-probe.log`. Remove: `podkop-probe --uninstall`.

- Never picked: ping 700 ms or more, or 40 Mbit/s or less
  (`--max-ping`, `--min-speed`).
- Servers are built by podkop itself: vless, trojan, ss, hysteria2 and socks
  over tcp, ws, grpc or xhttp. Others (vmess, ...) are skipped.
- "Europe only" checks the name, the server IP and the exit IP, so relays
  "через 🇷🇺" are skipped.
- "Device limit reached": free a device in your provider's bot.
- Backup before every change: `/etc/config/podkop.probe-backup.<date>`.
- `-v` shows every server and why it failed; `-h` lists all options.

## Layout

- `podkop_manager/`: the server (Python, FastAPI) and its web interface
- `router/`: files installed on the router: `podkop-agent`, its init script,
  `install.sh`, `probe.sh`
- `tools/sub-check.sh`: what a subscription returns to each client app
- [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)

## Коротко по-русски

Веб-интерфейс для podkop на сервере: `git clone`, `cp .env.example .env`,
впишите порт и пароль в `.env`, `docker compose up -d --build`, откройте
`http://<сервер>:<порт>` и добавьте роутер: выполните на роутере команду
из **Add router** и вставьте строку, которую она напечатает. Без сервера: выполните
команду из **podkop-probe without the manager** на роутере, вставьте ключи,
Enter — лучшие серверы попадут в podkop (`main`, `youtube` и по 5 резервных).
Каждую ночь: **Система → Планировщик**, строка `30 4 * * * podkop-probe --cron`.
